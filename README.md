# AudioController

# What this script does

This script, when activated, auto-mutes your main web browser (that you set manually) when VLC is playing a media file, and unmutes it when you pause the
media file.

# Why it exists

I like listening to streams while working/studying. But sometimes I need to listen to a recorded lecture as well. To listen to the lecture, I would have to
mute the stream I was listening to. But sometimes the lectures contained so much information that I would need to pause *them* to write down everything. But I
don't like silence, and so I would unmute the stream. Then when I was done writing the information, I would mute the stream and unpause the lecture.

This was getting very annoying. So I wrote a script to automate it.

I understand this solves an incredibly specific problem, but on the off chance that someone needs something like this, I'm uploading it to github. 
It's a bit of a pain in the ass to set up, but if you're like me then it's 100% worth it. Have fun.
